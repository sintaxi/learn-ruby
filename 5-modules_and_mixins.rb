# ================================
# Modules
#
# Modules are much like classes but
# unlike classes they cannot be instantiated.
# Modules are stand-alone libraries of code
# that are ideal for mixins and extending
# existing objects.

  module PaymentSystem
      
    # this is a ruby hook that gets
    # called when a module is included
    # in a class. The said class gets 
    # passed in as an argument.

      klass.extend(ClassMethods)

    # instance methods
    def pay

    # class methods
    module ClassMethods

  class Employee
    include PaymentSystem
    # we now have both the
    # instance and class methods
    # from PaymentSystem
